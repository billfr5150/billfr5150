## Featured Projects üíª

### [Slime City](ScreenShot)

![Screenshot](![image](https://github.com/billfr5150/billfr5150/assets/111128065/cdf07f6a-a704-45c1-9beb-5f1062e3ce78)
)

Slime City is a SimCity type simulation for a government customer.  It is a large, complex simulation that leverages actual location and chemical related data to assist in a training environment.  The Unity 3D game engine as well as several core assets were used to build this simulation. I also wrote a Game Data Editor to be used in conjunction with the game. Unfortuately, I cannot post the code as it is owned entirely by the customer.

### [Words For Me](project_2_link)

![WORDSFORME](https://wwww.5150games.com)

Words For Me is a soon to be released word search game for the IOS using the Unity 3D game engine. I plan on taking it down in 2 years and will post the code at that time. 

### [Brain Tease](project_2_link)

![BRAINTEASE](https://wwww.5150games.com)

### [After UX](project_2_link)

![AfterUX](https://wwww.5150games.com)

AfterUX is a 3D Shooter type game for IOS built with using the Unity 3D game engine. This project was one of the first I made in 2016 and I have to say ambitious mobile games. The code is quite dated but may give you some ideas for your next project. You can check out the repository [here](project_2_repository_link). Unfortuately, I cannot post the game models, textures as the majority of them are licensed for my use only. If you are interested in doing an actual build, I can send you a list of asset's that you would need to purchase from the Unity Asset Store.
